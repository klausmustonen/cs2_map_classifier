# CS2 Map Classification with Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project explores the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** for classifying **Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) maps** based on image data. We trained both models on a custom dataset of CS2 map images and evaluated their performance.  

## Results  
- **CNN outperforms SVC** in classification accuracy.  
- **CNN** achieved higher validation/test accuracy with lower training and validation errors.  
- **SVC** struggled, reaching only **~65% accuracy** with significant loss.  
- **CNN** performed better but remained **below 90% accuracy**, with room for improvement.
